      <p><em>こんにちは! (Hey!)</em> I’m <em>Naruto Uzumaki</em>, a Hidden Leaf Ninja and your next Hokage.
        <br/> I like instant ramen in a cup, and I really like the ramen Iruka
        Sensei got me at the Ichiraku Noodle Shop, but I hate the three minutes
        you have to wait after you pour the water in the ramen cup. My hobby is
        eating different kinds of ramen and comparing them, and my future dream
        is to be the greatest Hokage! Then the whole village will stop disrespecting
        me and start treating me like I'm somebody. <em>Somebody important!</em></p>

      <p>When people are protecting something truly special to them they
        can become as strong as they can be. I am strong because I have people
        to protect. Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my
        loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They're my friends.
        <br/> My power isn’t the Rasengan or Sage Jutsu or the Nine Tails chakra.
        My power is right here: <em>my heart.</em> Until I surpass my dreams, I refuse to die.
        I'm not gonna run away, I never go back on my word! That's my <em>にんど: my ninja way!</em></p>

        <p> Graduated as Genin

         <br/><em>Honed skills in taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu:</em> In case you
         didn't notice earlier, my Sexy Technique Jutsu is unmatched in the entire
         village. I think it’s important to be adaptable, and persuasive - this
         jutsu is key to taking you there! I also perfected my Shadow Clone Jutsu
         while attending classes, giving you not one - not ten - but hundreds of
         copies of myself. More to love! I also learned how to run up trees while
         attending the academy, which proved to be the most challenging of all.

         <br/><em>Served on missions for the Hidden Leaf Village:</em> under the careful
         watch of Kakashi Sensei, I joined Team 7 in spending day after day helping
         the Village with mundane tasks such as weeding gardens, locating lost
         kitties, and defeating Zabuza, the Demon of the Hidden Mist.</p>

       <p><b class="extra-special">Post-Academy Training:</b></p>
     </div>
       <p>Apprenticed under Jiraiya Sensei

       <br/><em>Gained ability to control Nine-Tails chakra:</em> Some people say that
       trial and error is the key to success. I have to agree! Jiraiya's patience
       in letting me get angsty and lash out (literally) was fundamental practice
       to learn how to tame the beast inside (also literally). Without this training,
       I would have never been able to get Kurama to acknowledge me.

       <br/><em>Conducted research:</em> I'd rather not go into detail about this,
       but you can read more about it in the gripping novel <i>Icha Icha - Makeout
       Paradise</i>. Or just ask Kakashi Sensei for a synopsis.

       <br/><em>Trained in Sage Art:</em> What they tell you is that you'll unlock
       powers beyond your wildest dreams; what they don't tell you is that it takes
       a whole lot of sitting around to get there first.

       <br/><em>Realized what it means to be a gutsy ninja:</em> Without Pervy  Sage, I'd be lost. </p>

       <p><b class="extra-special">Fourth Great Ninja War:</b></p>
     </div>
       <p>Served on the Frontlines

      <br/><em>Sent in the Clones:</em> Nothing can pull me away from learnin',
      but on the battlefield my Jinchuriki aura is burnin'!
      Um... I mean, while I was training with Killer Bee, I split myself into
      Shadow Clones to go assist my friends and allies. Like any good ninja would do!

      <br/><em>Saved the world from Infinite Tsukuyomi:</em> Amidst the twists and
      turns of the War, the Infinite Tsukuyomi was only a piece of the puzzle. Still,
      living in a fluffy fake-reality? Dream on! Kaguya couldn't stand a
      chance against Team 7 - all it takes is strategy, strength, and the bonds of
      friendship.</p>
