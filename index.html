         <p>
         <br/><em>Honed skills in taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu:</em> In case you
         didn't notice earlier, my Sexy Technique Jutsu is unmatched in the entire
         village. I think it’s important to be adaptable, and persuasive - this
         jutsu is key to taking you there! I also perfected my Shadow Clone Jutsu
         while attending classes, giving you not one - not ten - but hundreds of
         copies of myself. More to love! I also learned how to run up trees while
         attending the academy, which proved to be the most challenging of all.

         <br/><em>Served on missions for the Hidden Leaf Village:</em> under the careful
         watch of Kakashi Sensei, I joined Team 7 in spending day after day helping
         the Village with mundane tasks such as weeding gardens, locating lost
         kitties, and defeating Zabuza, the Demon of the Hidden Mist.</p>

     </div>
        <p>
       <br/><em>Gained ability to control Nine-Tails chakra:</em> Some people say that
       trial and error is the key to success. I have to agree! Jiraiya's patience
       in letting me get angsty and lash out (literally) was fundamental practice
       to learn how to tame the beast inside (also literally). Without this training,
       I would have never been able to get Kurama to acknowledge me.

       <br/><em>Conducted research:</em> I'd rather not go into detail about this,
       but you can read more about it in the gripping novel <i>Icha Icha - Makeout
       Paradise</i>. Or just ask Kakashi Sensei for a synopsis.

       <br/><em>Trained in Sage Art:</em> What they tell you is that you'll unlock
       powers beyond your wildest dreams; what they don't tell you is that it takes
       a whole lot of sitting around to get there first.

       <br/><em>Realized what it means to be a gutsy ninja:</em> Without Pervy  Sage, I'd be lost. </p>

      <br/><em>Sent in the Clones:</em> Nothing can pull me away from learnin',
      but on the battlefield my Jinchuriki aura is burnin'!
      Um... I mean, while I was training with Killer Bee, I split myself into
      Shadow Clones to go assist my friends and allies. Like any good ninja would do!

      <br/><em>Saved the world from Infinite Tsukuyomi:</em> Amidst the twists and
      turns of the War, the Infinite Tsukuyomi was only a piece of the puzzle. Still,
      living in a fluffy fake-reality? Dream on! Kaguya couldn't stand a
      chance against Team 7 - all it takes is strategy, strength, and the bonds of
      friendship.</p>
